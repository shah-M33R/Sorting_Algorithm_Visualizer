    <h1>Glossary of Fundamental Concepts</h1>
    <p>This document defines the core technical concepts and algorithms used within the Interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Sorting Algorithm</dt>
        <dd>A defined sequence of instructions that arranges elements of a list in a specific order (typically ascending or descending). Examples implemented include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Radix Sort.</dd>

        <dt>Time Complexity (Big O)</dt>
        <dd>A theoretical measure of the execution time of an algorithm relative to the input size <em>n</em>. It classifies algorithms based on how their run-time grows as input size increases (e.g., O(n²) grows quadratically, while O(n log n) is significantly faster for large data).</dd>

        <dt>Delta Compression</dt>
        <dd>An optimization technique used in the project's backend. Instead of saving the entire state of the array at every step, only the changes (differences or "deltas")—such as specific swapped indices—are recorded. This drastically reduces file size and memory usage.</dd>

        <dt>Pivot</dt>
        <dd>A key element selected in Quick Sort. The array is partitioned around this element such that all values smaller than the pivot are placed to its left, and all larger values to its right. The visualizer highlights the pivot in Violet.</dd>

        <dt>Instrumentation</dt>
        <dd>The process of injecting monitoring code (like `record()`) into the sorting algorithms. This allows the system to track metrics like comparison counts and swap counts without altering the mathematical result of the sort.</dd>

        <dt>Heapify</dt>
        <dd>The process used in Heap Sort to maintain the "Heap Property" (where a parent node is always larger than its children in a Max-Heap). Visualized as elements "sinking" down the tree structure mapped to the array.</dd>

        <dt>Stable Sort</dt>
        <dd>A sorting algorithm that maintains the relative order of records with equal keys. Merge Sort and Radix Sort are examples of stable sorts, whereas Quick Sort and Heap Sort are unstable.</dd>

        <dt>Canvas API</dt>
        <dd>An HTML5 technology used by the frontend to draw graphics via JavaScript. It is used here for "Immediate Mode" rendering, which is significantly more performant than DOM manipulation for drawing thousands of moving bars at 60 FPS.</dd>

        <dt>Serialization</dt>
        <dd>The process of converting complex data structures (like the C++ sorting history objects) into a format (JSON string) that can be stored in a file or transmitted over a network.</dd>
